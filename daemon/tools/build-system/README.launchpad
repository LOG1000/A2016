To push packages for a new Ubuntu distribution on launchpad, you'll need to
modify the following files:

tools/build-system/launchpad/dput.conf
tools/build-system/setenv.sh

See commit 1b19e3869aa5e4632b8b043f47024297218ed2c5 for an example.

In addition, you'll have to modify the sflphone-package-manager job on Jenkins, specifically
Configure->Build->Execute Shell (add new distro).
